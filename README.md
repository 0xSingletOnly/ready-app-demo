# Ready- ISP User Onboarding Service
Hello there! This is my demo as part of my job application for Ready.

Pain point: When using a new ISP, it can be easy to get lost in the documentations (outdated websites, PDFs with poor links). New users have to spend time browsing/searching for their solution (e.g. what does the red light on that modem mean). This search is often slow and frustrating.

Solution: Ready Now, the ISP Onboarding Service, allows users to ask questions in natural language and get their solution. This reduces friction in finding the right answer, and new users can enjoy the services of their ISP much quicker.

Technical details: Ready Now uses RAG with a ChromaDB. To illustrate how this can work for a ISP, I've selected X ISP, and passed its PDF as part of building the RAG system. In addition, I've opted for a small language model to show that this process can be cost-effective at scale.
