title: "Managing and optimizing your in-home WiFi network"
---


Many factors can impact WiFi connectivity in your home. If you’re having WiFi performance issues, you can troubleshoot using the Xfinity app from your mobile device, or if you’d prefer, chat with the Xfinity Assistant from your computer. You can also try following some of the other methods listed below.

Xfinity customers who rely on non-verbal communication have access to dedicated customer support services through our ASL Support Center.
Run a full network test

If you rent an Xfinity Gateway, our all-in-one WiFi modem and router, you can use the Xfinity app to run a full network test to detect and troubleshoot several different connectivity issues. The full network test checks your network for:

    Outages.
    The speed of the internet connection to your gateway.
    The strength of the connection to all your devices.

Check gateway or router placement



Place your gateway, modem, or router in the most central location of your home, preferably on the main floor instead of the attic or basement. Make sure it's in an upright position at least a couple of feet off the floor and confirm that the coax cable connection is finger tight.

Avoid putting your gateway or router in cramped spaces or next to anything that can block the WiFi signal, the best position is in an open, well-ventilated space.

To minimize signal inferference, place your gateway away from:

    Walls and furniture, including large mirrors.
    Metal surfaces (including computer cases).
    Halogen or fluorescent lighting.
    Microwaves and refrigerators.
    TVs and computer monitors.
    Most cordless phones.
    Baby monitors.
    Bluetooth-connected devices.
    Large amounts of water (like aquariums and water heaters).

Note: Consider adding WiFi Boost Pods to help extend your home WiFi coverage throughout your home. To learn more and purchase, go to xfinity.com/xfipods.
Confirm your device is connected to your in-home WiFi network

Sometimes you may be connected to your gateway's public WiFi hotspot network (xfinitywifi) or secure hotspot network (XFINITY), which can limit your WiFi speed. Go to the WiFi settings of your personal device to make sure you're connected to your personal in-home WiFi network.

Make sure the device isn’t blocked or paused in the Xfinity app. Learn how to unpause the device by reviewing Personalize and control your home network with Xfinity xFi.
Use a single WiFi name for your Xfinity home network

If you have a gateway, you should simplify your WiFi by using a single name and password for your home network. Gateways are "dual band" or “tri band," depending on the model. This means that they broadcast distinct radio bands for their WiFi network — either 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, or 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.

Using a single name and password for all bands lets your gateway determine which one will provide a seamless connection to the best network available at any given time.

Learn more about the benefits of using one WiFi name and password.
Connect high-bandwidth devices through Ethernet

Whenever possible, plugging stationary devices directly into your gateway or router using an Ethernet cable may provide optimal connectivity. For example, it may be ideal for desktop computers, gaming consoles, and video streaming devices to be connected with an Ethernet cable instead of connecting wirelessly, since activities on those devices use a lot of bandwidth (e.g., graphic-rich online gaming, movies, or TV shows).

Ethernet cables carry a specific category rating that determines max speeds. The higher the category, the faster the cable. For assistance with installation of select equipment and services not covered by Xfinity, see HelloTech overview.
Check Bridge Mode and antennae for third-party routers

If you use your own router along with your gateway, make sure the gateway is in Bridge Mode. Learn more about Bridge Mode. You'll also want to position the antennae of your router so that one is pointing vertically (12 o'clock), and the other one is pointing horizontally (either three or nine o'clock) to broadcast the strongest signal.

Note: You can find the best router optimization option for your specific device from the device manufacturer.
Consider a different speed option

If many devices access your home WiFi network at the same time, you may want to consider a higher speed tier to improve your network's performance by increasing your overall bandwidth. We offer several speed options to serve your needs. Visit xfinity.com to see which level of internet service you have and the upgrade options that are available.
Other factors that may impact WiFi connectivity

    Technical limitations of personal devices (e.g., an older phone that can't handle faster speeds, out of date operating systems, etc.).
    The distance between your personal devices and your gateway, modem, or router.
    Older devices which could be consuming bandwidth and slowing down your network.
    Interference from neighboring WiFi networks, especially during peak hours.
