FAQs

Do I need any tools to set up my Xfinity devices?
You do not need any tools to connect your devices. Getting Started kits come with the devices and wiring to set up your Xfinity services in just a few fast and easy steps!

When do I activate my services?
For most orders, activation can be done any time between the day the equipment arrives and up to seven days after. 

For Xfinity Voice orders with a ported phone number, the service must be activated on the Firm Order Commitment (FOC) date (received at the time you place your order). If your Xfinity Voice service isnâ€™t activated, you could lose of dial tone and/or the phone number.
