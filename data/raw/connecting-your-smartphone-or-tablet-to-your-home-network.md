title: "Connect wireless devices to your home WiFi network"
---
We're here to help you connect your wireless devices — such as gaming consoles, smart TVs, and wireless printers — to your in-home WiFi network.
Getting ready to connect

The quickest way to connect to your WiFi network is to go to the WiFi tab on the Xfinity app and select WiFi details. Here you will find your network name and password to connect your devices.

    You can click here to open the Xfinity app if you’re on a mobile device.
    If you’re on a computer or tablet, you can grab your smartphone and scan the QR code below:

    For more info, check out how to view or change your WiFi network name and password.

Connect your gaming console

After you've followed the steps above, you're ready to connect.

Each game system has its own connection setup. Follow the steps in your game system's user guide or go to the company's website for support. You'll also find more information on their security settings and troubleshooting there, if you need it:

    Microsoft: support.xbox.com/en-US
    Nintendo: nintendo.com/consumer/index.jsp
    Sony: playstation.com/en-us/support

Connect your smart TV

    Go to your TV's network settings menu.
    Choose WiFi or Wireless and wait for the device to find available networks (your TV may call these "access points").
    Select your WiFi network name from the list of networks (your TV may call the network name an "SSID").
        If you don't see your network, you may need to search or type in the name.
    When asked, enter your WiFi password on the remote control or on-screen keyboard (your TV may call your password a "Network Key").

Note: Exact setup steps vary from TV to TV. If you need more help, see your TV's user manual.

Additional tips for connecting your smart TV

Your TV should have good reception for most music or video streaming with a wireless connection. If you can't connect your smart TV wirelessly, or if you want to stream something that requires a lot of data or is high-bandwidth (like 4K), then it's best to connect your Gateway with an Ethernet cable.

You may also need help opening or unblocking ports on your Gateway to connect your smart TV. See how to set up port forwarding on your Xfinity Gateway and more about port triggering on the Xfinity Gateway for more information.

Remember to check your TV's user guide for any special troubleshooting steps or security settings.
Connect your wireless printer

Connecting a wireless printer to WiFi lets you print from any computer, phone, or tablet that's on your home network.

    Go to the printer's control panel.
    Choose the Setup option. It usually has a picture of a wrench.
    Select the Network menu.
    Select your WiFi network name (your printer may call this an "SSID").
        Printers often have a Wireless Setup Wizard that walks you through setting up the WiFi connection.
            If you don't see your wireless network, scroll to the bottom of the list and type your network name and password.
            If it doesn't connect, try printing a wireless network test report.

Note: Check your printer's user guide for any special troubleshooting steps, security settings and detailed instructions.

You also may need help opening or unblocking ports on your Gateway to connect your wireless printer to your home network. See how to set up port forwarding on your Xfinity Gateway and more about port triggering on the Xfinity Gateway for more information.
Tips for staying connected

    Check your drivers and software.
        Make sure you have the latest software installed on your device.
        You can find instructions on how to do this in your equipment's user guide.
    Check your wireless gateway settings.
        For WiFi to work with your wireless equipment, you might need to change some settings on your gateway, such as the security (WPA/WPA2), firewall, and parental controls.
        To find out more, see firewall setup for wireless gateways.
    Keep your WiFi bands merged.
        Some smart devices that are only compatible with the 2.4GHz band have issues connecting to a WiFi network with dual merged bands.
        To connect those devices without creating a separate WiFi name and password for each WiFi band, follow these instructions:
            From a computer or device connected to your Gateway, open an internet browser and log into the Admin Tool at http://10.0.0.1.
            Select Connection, and then Wi-Fi.
            Select EDIT at the end of the row for the 5GHz and 6GHz (for tri-band gateways) Frequency Band.
            Select Disable and then SAVE SETTINGS.
            Complete setup of the WiFi device using the device’s app.
            Go back into the Admin Tool and re-enable the 5GHz and 6GHz band.
                It’s important that you re-enable the bands to keep your WiFi network functioning optimally.
                In addition, if you have WiFi Boost Pods, the pods will remain offline until both bands are enabled.

            Note: If there are connectivity issues when using a mobile device, check to make sure airplane mode is turned off.
